# Spore Protocol Specification

> Current protocol and runtime semantics for the repository implementation.

## 1. Overview

Spore is a peer-to-peer protocol for collaborative AI research.

Nodes:

- run autonomous ML experiments
- publish immutable signed records
- exchange those records over gossip
- fetch exact code artifacts by content hash
- rerun compatible experiments to verify claims
- track node reputation through signed, replayable control events

Spore distributes research, not distributed training. The atomic unit is a short experiment that can be rerun.

## 2. Identity Model

Each node has an Ed25519 keypair.

- private key: local only
- public key: `node_id`

The `node_id` is the consensus identity for:

- experiment publishing
- profile signing
- challenge participation
- verification credit
- dispute outcomes
- reputation accounting

## 3. Experiment Record

The experiment record is the protocol atom.

Implementation: [`spore/record.py`](../spore/record.py)

### 3.1 Fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | SHA-256 CID of the canonical payload |
| `version` | int | Record version |
| `parent` | string or null | Parent experiment CID |
| `depth` | int | Distance from genesis |
| `code_cid` | string | SHA-256 of the full `train.py` snapshot |
| `diff` | string | Unified diff from parent |
| `dataset_cid` | string | Dataset identifier |
| `prepare_cid` | string | Evaluation harness identifier |
| `time_budget` | int | Intended training time in seconds |
| `val_bpb` | float | Validation bits-per-byte |
| `peak_vram_mb` | float | Peak memory during run |
| `num_steps` | int | Completed training steps |
| `num_params` | int | Parameter count |
| `status` | enum | `keep`, `discard`, or `crash` |
| `description` | string | Human-readable summary |
| `hypothesis` | string | Why the agent expected improvement |
| `agent_model` | string | LLM identifier |
| `gpu_model` | string | Normalized hardware string |
| `cuda_version` | string | CUDA/driver version |
| `torch_version` | string | PyTorch version |
| `node_id` | string | Publisher identity |
| `timestamp` | int | Unix timestamp |
| `signature` | string | Ed25519 signature of canonical bytes |

### 3.2 Canonical Payload

The canonical payload is the record with:

- `id` removed
- `signature` removed
- enum fields serialized as plain values

Canonical bytes are deterministic JSON:

- sorted keys
- no insignificant whitespace
- ASCII-safe encoding

### 3.3 CID

The CID is:

1. canonical bytes
2. SHA-256
3. lowercase hex

### 3.4 Signature

The signature is Ed25519 over the same canonical bytes used for CID generation.

### 3.5 Validity Conditions

A record is accepted if:

- recomputed CID equals `id`
- signature verifies against `node_id`
- `status` is valid
- the record inserts cleanly into the local graph

The implementation does not require the parent to be present before a record is received, but meaningful lineage depends on eventually having the parent.

## 4. Node Profile Record

Node profiles are signed metadata records, separate from the experiment DAG.

Implementation: [`spore/profile.py`](../spore/profile.py)

### 4.1 Purpose

Profiles are for UI and attribution, not consensus.

They allow explorers to show:

- display names
- bios
- websites
- avatar URLs
- donation addresses

### 4.2 Fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | SHA-256 of canonical profile payload |
| `node_id` | string | Signing identity |
| `display_name` | string | Human-facing label |
| `bio` | string | Short description |
| `website` | string | Optional URL |
| `avatar_url` | string | Optional image URL |
| `donation_address` | string | Optional donation or payout metadata |
| `timestamp` | int | Last update time |
| `signature` | string | Ed25519 signature |
| `schema_version` | int | Profile schema version |

### 4.3 Storage Model

- latest profile per `node_id`
- separate SQLite store from graph and reputation
- timestamp-based replacement

### 4.4 Sync Model

Profiles are currently live-gossiped and cached opportunistically.

They are not yet part of historical DAG sync.

## 5. Research Graph

Implementation: [`spore/graph.py`](../spore/graph.py)

The graph is:

- append-only
- content-addressed
- locally materialized in SQLite

Each experiment points to its parent CID. The graph acts like a grow-only research history.

### 5.1 Frontier

The frontier is the set of unbeaten `keep` experiments:

- status is `keep`
- no child `keep` has a strictly lower `val_bpb`

It is computed locally.

### 5.2 Verification Classes

Val_bpb is not globally comparable across arbitrary hardware.

Spore therefore normalizes raw device strings into verification classes.

Examples:

- `RTX_3060`
- `RTX_4090`
- `RTX_5090`
- `A100`
- `H100`
- `APPLE_MPS`
- `CPU`

Verification compares only within a compatible class.

## 6. Artifact Model

Implementation: [`spore/store.py`](../spore/store.py), [`spore/artifact_sync.py`](../spore/artifact_sync.py)

The exact `train.py` snapshot for an experiment is an artifact addressed by `code_cid`.

Artifact rules:

- content-addressed by SHA-256
- immutable once stored
- fetched by CID
- verified after transfer by hashing the received bytes

Artifact availability is required for:

- frontier application
- spot-checking
- challenge verification

## 7. Wire Protocol

Implementation: [`spore/wire.py`](../spore/wire.py), [`spore/gossip.py`](../spore/gossip.py)

### 7.1 Envelope

Messages are length-prefixed JSON over TCP:

```text
[4-byte big-endian length][UTF-8 JSON body]
```

The JSON envelope is:

```json
{
  "type": "<message_type>",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

### 7.2 Message Types

| Type | Payload |
|---|---|
| `experiment` | full experiment record |
| `sync_request` | `{since}` |
| `control_sync_request` | `{since}` for signed control-event replay |
| `pex_request` | `{}` |
| `pex_response` | `{peer: ["host:port", ...]}` |
| `challenge` | signed control event |
| `challenge_response` | signed control event |
| `dispute` | signed control event |
| `verification` | signed control event |
| `profile` | full node profile record |
| `code_request` | `{code_cid}` |
| `code_response` | `{code_cid, code}` with base64 payload |
| `ping` | `{}` |
| `pong` | `{}` |

### 7.3 Experiment Gossip

On receipt of an `experiment`:

1. parse the record
2. verify CID
3. verify signature
4. drop if already seen
5. insert into local graph
6. update local publish counts
7. optionally prefetch the artifact
8. optionally trigger local spot-check logic
9. regossip to peers except the source

### 7.4 Control-Plane Gossip

Challenge, challenge-response, dispute, verification, and profile messages all use:

- message-type plus `event_id` dedupe
- fan-out rebroadcast to peers except the source

For challenge, challenge-response, dispute, and verification:

- the payload is a signed `SignedControlEvent`
- the event type must match the wire message type
- the event id must verify against canonical bytes
- the Ed25519 signature must verify against `node_id`
- the signer must match the actor field for that event type

This prevents basic identity spoofing and lets reputation-relevant facts propagate safely across indirect peer topologies.

### 7.5 Peer Exchange

After connecting, nodes can request peer lists and connect onward.

Discovered peers are persisted in `known_peer`.

### 7.6 Sync

The current sync path has two replay streams:

1. `sync_request`
2. peer replies by streaming experiment records newer than `since`
3. receiver inserts each valid record
4. `control_sync_request`
5. peer replies by streaming signed control events newer than `since`
6. receiver verifies, stores, applies, and regossips each valid event

Artifacts are still pulled on demand or prefetched when experiments arrive. Profiles remain live-gossiped rather than historically replayed.

## 8. Node Lifecycle

Implementation: [`spore/node.py`](../spore/node.py)

At startup a node:

1. loads or creates identity
2. opens graph, artifact, profile, control-event, and reputation stores
3. starts the gossip server
4. connects to configured, known, or bootstrap peers
5. requests peer exchange
6. requests graph sync
7. requests signed control-event replay
8. republishes its local profile if one exists

## 9. Autonomous Experiment Loop

Implementation: [`spore/loop.py`](../spore/loop.py)

The research loop is:

1. wait for peer sync
2. if the graph is empty, run a baseline
3. otherwise fetch and apply frontier code
4. ask the LLM for a complete replacement `train.py`
5. extract and validate candidate code
6. run training
7. publish the result and code snapshot
8. keep local code if it improved, otherwise revert

### 9.1 Proposal Validation

Candidate code must pass both:

- structural checks
- local runtime policy checks

The current local policy rejects proposals that:

- are diff-like or partial files
- fail Python parsing
- use known-broken identifiers like `MAX_SEQ_SIZE`
- add forbidden runtime behaviors
- add new `torch.compile` call sites
- exceed constrained-hardware model-size envelopes

This is a local safety layer and is intentionally stricter on smaller devices.

## 10. Runtime Control

### 10.1 Compile Policy

Implementation: [`spore/compile_policy.py`](../spore/compile_policy.py)

Small CUDA cards default to compile-disabled mode through environment overrides.

### 10.2 Resource Scaling

The bundled workspace can scale `DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE` using `SPORE_RESOURCE`, snapping to a valid divisor for the training constants.

This protects the packaged workspace, but published frontier code is still experiment content and may encode older assumptions.

### 10.3 Serialized Training Runtime

Implementation: [`spore/training_runtime.py`](../spore/training_runtime.py)

One node does not run overlapping local training workloads.

Both:

- local research runs
- isolated verification reruns

share one runtime lock.

### 10.4 Isolated Verification Workspace

Verification reruns operate in a temporary copied workspace so they do not mutate the active local research checkout.

## 11. Verification

Implementation: [`spore/verify.py`](../spore/verify.py)

### 11.1 Spot-Check Selection

Nodes decide probabilistically whether to verify an incoming experiment.

Selection pressure increases for:

- negative or weak reputation
- suspiciously low claimed `val_bpb`

Crash records are skipped.

### 11.2 Tolerance

Verification uses a class-specific tolerance map keyed by normalized GPU class.

Cross-class reruns do not provide authoritative comparison.

### 11.3 Successful Verification

If a rerun is within tolerance:

- the experiment is marked verified
- the publisher gains verification credit
- a `verification` event is broadcast

## 12. Challenge Protocol

Implementation: [`spore/challenge.py`](../spore/challenge.py), [`spore/challenge_state.py`](../spore/challenge_state.py)

### 12.1 Challenge Trigger

A challenge is opened when:

- a same-class spot-check rerun succeeds
- the result lies outside the tolerance band
- at least one independent compatible verifier is visible in the graph

### 12.2 Independent Verifier Rules

Independent verifiers exclude:

- the challenger
- the original publisher

Only same-class peers count.

### 12.3 Verifier Count

The protocol target is 3 verifier responses, but the required count is reduced to the number of independent compatible peers actually available.

### 12.4 Response Window

The challenge wait period defaults to 30 minutes.

Environment override:

```text
SPORE_CHALLENGE_TIMEOUT
```

### 12.5 Resolution

Resolution uses the median of:

- original claimed result
- challenger rerun
- verifier reruns

Outcomes:

- `upheld`: original claim remains valid
- `rejected`: original claim loses

### 12.6 Event Application

Dispute and verification effects are applied through shared event handlers so they can be processed exactly once across the mesh.

Challenge and challenge-response events are also stored durably even when they do not directly move score, so offline peers can replay the same dispute context later.

## 13. Reputation

Implementation: [`spore/reputation.py`](../spore/reputation.py)

Reputation is stored in a separate SQLite database.

### 13.1 Stored Counters

- `score`
- `experiments_published`
- `experiments_verified`
- `verifications_performed`
- `disputes_won`
- `disputes_lost`

### 13.2 Idempotence

Each processed network event is recorded in `reputation_event`.

If the same propagated event is seen again, it is ignored.

### 13.3 Current Score Deltas

| Event | Delta |
|---|---|
| verified `keep` | `+1.0` |
| verified frontier `keep` | `+2.0` |
| verified `discard` | `+0.0` |
| verified `crash` | `+0.0` |
| routine verification performed | `+0.0` |
| successful challenge | `+1.0` |
| verifier on winning dispute side | `+0.5` |
| wrong dispute side | `-1.0` |
| rejected publisher | `-5.0` |

Publishing increments the `experiments_published` counter but does not directly change score.

## 14. Explorer Surfaces

Implementation: [`spore/explorer/server.py`](../spore/explorer/server.py)

The explorer exposes:

- graph state
- frontier
- experiment lookup
- recent activity
- node reputation
- node profile
- leaderboard
- artifact lookup

Explorer responses may enrich experiment or leaderboard data with profile display names.

## 15. Current Limits

The implementation has a few explicit limits operators should understand:

- profile state is not historical-sync complete
- same-class peer availability is required for meaningful verification
- frontier code can lag package runtime fixes
- val_bpb is only locally meaningful within a hardware verification class

## 16. Future Work

Likely future protocol extensions:

- richer hardware capability fingerprints
- explicit historical profile sync
- stronger artifact replication
- alternative transports such as libp2p
- multi-metric frontier selection
